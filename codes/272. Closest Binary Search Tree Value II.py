# Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

# Note:
# Given target value is a floating point.
# You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
# You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
# Follow up:
# Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?

# Hint:

# Consider implement these two helper functions:
# getPredecessor(N), which returns the next smaller node to N.
# getSuccessor(N), which returns the next larger node to N.
# Try to assume that each node has a parent pointer, it makes the problem much easier.
# Without parent pointer we just need to keep track of the path from the root to the current node using a stack.
# You would need two stacks to track the path in finding predecessor and successor node separately.
